Opens a LED device<br/>
<br/>
This class can control your computer's build-in LEDs, such as the ones
commonly used to indicate the power status and disk activity.</br>
<br/>
Your operating system might not be set up to allow regular users to do
this kind of modification. If this is the case you should install a
so-called <i>udev rule</i> that relaxes the permissions for the files
in /sys/class/leds. You can also try running Processing as root user
using "sudo", but this is generally not recommended.
